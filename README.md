# RESTful_web_api
This is a small web api I made via the Go documentation webpage tutorial sections. 
Some plans are to:
  1. add the capability of updating the catalogue of Jazz albums by parsing an xls file
  2. Using a database query for accessing more albums and downloading into either a JSON or XLS file.
  3. Adding an html layer with some small clips of sounds for each album
